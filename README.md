# OBMetaProducerFML-1710

Minecraft Forge 1.7.10 mod to gather meta data for use by external tools, utilities and monitoring.
Outputs player position data every 5 seconds for use with player markers on our Overviewer maps for example.

This is very specific to our needs and setup so of not much value to anyone out there I would think.
This is also the complete Eclipse project so it should import into Eclipse (I was using Oxygen.3.a Release 4.7.3a).

Compiled for Forge/Minecraft 1.7.10.
